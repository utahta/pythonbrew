Overview
========

pythonbrew is a program to automate the building and installation of Python in the users HOME.

pythonbrew is inspired by `perlbrew <http://github.com/gugod/App-perlbrew>`_ and `rvm <https://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm>`_.

Installation
============

The recommended way to download and install pythonbrew is to run these statements in your shell::

  curl -kLO http://github.com/utahta/pythonbrew/raw/master/pythonbrew-install
  chmod +x pythonbrew-install
  ./pythonbrew-install

or more simply like this::

  curl -kL http://github.com/utahta/pythonbrew/raw/master/pythonbrew-install | bash

After that, pythonbrew installs itself to ~/.pythonbrew, and you should follow the instruction on screen to setup your .bashrc to put it in your PATH.

If you need to install pythonbrew into somewhere else, you can do that by setting a PYTHONBREW_ROOT environment variable::

  export PYTHONBREW_ROOT=/path/to/pythonbrew
  ./pythonbrew-install
