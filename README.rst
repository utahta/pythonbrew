Overview
========

pythonbrew is a program to automate the building and installation of Python in the users $HOME.

pythonbrew is inspired by `perlbrew <http://github.com/gugod/App-perlbrew>`_ and `rvm <https://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm>`_.

:Forked: `pythonz <https://github.com/saghul/pythonz>`_

Installation
============

The recommended way to download and install pythonbrew is to run these statements in your shell::

  curl -kL http://xrl.us/pythonbrewinstall | bash

After that, pythonbrew installs itself to ~/.pythonbrew. 

Please add the following line to the end of your ~/.bashrc::

  [[ -s $HOME/.pythonbrew/etc/bashrc ]] && source $HOME/.pythonbrew/etc/bashrc

If you need to install pythonbrew into somewhere else, you can do that by setting a PYTHONBREW_ROOT environment variable::

  export PYTHONBREW_ROOT=/path/to/pythonbrew
  curl -kLO http://xrl.us/pythonbrewinstall
  chmod +x pythonbrewinstall
  ./pythonbrewinstall

Readline Support
----------------

Python uses a library called `readline` to allow line editing and command history.  If you use Python interactively, it is recommended to install both the `readline` library and its headers.  Otherwise, the arrow keys won't work in the Python interactive shell.

On Debian and Ubuntu systems, the required package is called `libreadline-dev`.  On Fedora, Red Hat, and CentOS, the package is called `readline-devel`.  No extra packages are required on Arch or Gentoo.

The `readline` support package must be installed before Python in order to work properly.

For Systemwide(Multi-User) installation
---------------------------------------

If the install script is run as root, pythonbrew will automatically install into /usr/local/pythonbrew.

The pythonbrew will be automatically configured for every user on the system if you install as root.

After installation, where you would normally use `sudo`, non-root users will need to use `sudopybrew`::

  sudopybrew install -v -j2 2.7.2

  pythonbrew install http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7/Python-2.7.2.tgz
  pythonbrew install /path/to/Python-2.7.2.tgz
  pythonbrew install /path/to/Python-2.7.2
  pythonbrew install 2.7.2 3.2
  
Permanently use the specified python::

  pythonbrew switch 2.7.2
  pythonbrew switch 3.2

Use the specified python in current shell::

  pythonbrew use 2.7.2

Runs a named python file against specified and/or all pythons::

  pythonbrew py test.py
  pythonbrew py -v test.py # Show verbose output
  pythonbrew py -p 2.7.2 -p 3.2 test.py # Use the specified pythons

List the installed pythons::

  pythonbrew cleanup

Upgrades pythonbrew to the latest version::

  pythonbrew update
  pythonbrew update --master
  pythonbrew update --develop

Disable pythonbrew::

  pythonbrew symlink pip # Create a symbolic link to the specified script in bin directory
  pythonbrew symlink -r # Remove a symbolic link
  pythonbrew symlink -v foo # Create a symbolic link to the specified virtual environment python in bin directory

Runs the buildout with specified or current using python::
  
  pythonbrew buildout
  pythonbrew buildout -p 2.6.6

Create isolated python environments (uses virtualenv)::
  
  pythonbrew venv init
  pythonbrew venv create proj
