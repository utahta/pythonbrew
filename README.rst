Overview
========

pythonbrew is a program to automate the building and installation of Python in the users $HOME.

pythonbrew is inspired by `perlbrew <http://github.com/gugod/App-perlbrew>`_ and `rvm <https://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm>`_.

Installation
============

The recommended way to download and install pythonbrew is to run these statements in your shell::

  curl -kL http://xrl.us/pythonbrewinstall | bash

After that, pythonbrew installs itself to ~/.pythonbrew. 

Please add the following line to the end of your ~/.bashrc::

  [[ -s $HOME/.pythonbrew/etc/bashrc ]] && source $HOME/.pythonbrew/etc/bashrc

If you need to install pythonbrew into somewhere else, you can do that by setting a PYTHONBREW_ROOT environment variable::

  export PYTHONBREW_ROOT=/path/to/pythonbrew
  curl -kLO http://xrl.us/pythonbrewinstall
  chmod +x pythonbrewinstall
  ./pythonbrewinstall
